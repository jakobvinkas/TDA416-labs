# Thoughts

There are six different operation types for the Splay tree:

1. Zig
2. Zag
3. Zig-zig
4. Zag-zag
5. Zig-zag
6. Zag-zig

Each of these operations consists of left and right rotations around different edges. The Zig and Zag operations are special since they operate on the root of the tree.

We can define two methods for left and right rotations around a node:

    void rotateLeft(Node n);
    void rotateLeft(Node n);

And then use these methods to define methods for the six different operations:

    void zig(Node n);
    void zag(Node n);
    void zigZig(Node n);
    void zagZag(Node n);
    void zigZag(Node n);
    void zagZig(Node n);

It would then be trivial to look at the state of the tree to determine which operation that should be run, and then just execute the appropriate method.

We must be careful to not forget to update the `parent` reference when updating the child of a node. I'm thinking that we should implement `setLeftChild(Node n)` and `setRightChild(Node n)` that automatically takes care of updating `parent`.
